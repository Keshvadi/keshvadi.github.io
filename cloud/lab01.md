first, we going to learn about JSON format. 

What is the JSON file? Why we want to use this? why not using the tables that we learnt in database course? why software engineers make our life more difficult?

Now, lets say that we have a JSON file. How can we parse it? lets say we want to use python for it. is there any library that make our life easier with working with JSON files?

What is an API exactly? 
I was thinking what a student might know about API and how can I teach you. Then I decided to show you how to actually create an api and run it and test it and ask your friends also to test it to see what an api means. In this way you can make a sense of API in your own observation.

<!-- create an API -->

If this was the first time you created an API, it might be an exciting experince.
Note that this API doesnot have any authentication. Anyone can send request for any number of times. We will talk about this later in this course how to use AWS services to manage API. As you see, creating an API is not that much difficult. AWS gives you services to manage it. So, if you learn how to manage it yourself, you don't need to pay AWS. but the idea is that. you focus on you app and leave all these small things to the AWS.

Now that you created an API, give me two use cases that a software engineere can develop and run an API.
