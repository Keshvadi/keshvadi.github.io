# Lab: Using `ps` and `kill` to Manage Processes

## Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use the `ps` command to list running processes and the `kill` command to terminate them. These commands are fundamental for managing processes in a Unix-like operating system. You will practice viewing and terminating processes to gain valuable skills for troubleshooting and system management.

## Prerequisites

- A Unix-like operating system (e.g., Linux or macOS)
- A terminal or shell for running commands

## Lab Steps

### Step 1: View Running Processes

1. Open your terminal.

2. Run a command that will run for a while, such as `sleep 1000`. This command will essentially "sleep" for 1000 seconds.

   ```bash
   sleep 1000
   ```
