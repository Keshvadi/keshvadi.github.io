One mischief always introduces another.
Friends are good, good, if well chosen.
To be troubled in trouble, is to have your trouble doubled. 
Tears never stop misery.
Fear of danger is ten thousand times more terrifying than danger itself when apparent to the eyes, and we find the burden of anxiety greater, by much, that the evil which we are anxious about.

Daniel Defoe, English writer, 1660 - 1731
