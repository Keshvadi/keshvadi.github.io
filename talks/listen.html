      Operators of large wide-area networks (WANs) have long realized the
      importance of intra-domain path optimization based on demand and traffic
      characteristics.

      In these networks, often based on software-defined networking (SDN),
      centralized controllers (i) monitor the state of the network and analyze
      the specific requirements of traffic flows; (ii) optimize the network
      paths and assign them to flows according to such requirements; and (iii)
      constantly and rapidly update to accommodate new applications with
      different path-optimization criteria.

      These networks thus provide a flexible and performant platform, where
      traditional applications thrive and new ones can evolve, such as
      cloud-based gaming [3] or holographic communication [4].
