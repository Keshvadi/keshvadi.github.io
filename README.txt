1.      Mount Royal University is a teaching-focused institution. If you were to teach your favourite course (one that puts a smile on your face and your students), what course would it be and why?
2.      Our faculty build impactful research programs and mobilize the associated knowledge for the benefit of our students and the wider community. Can you provide an example of how you bring your research into the classroom, or how you might otherwise involve undergraduates in your research?
3.      MRU strives to create an environment that is inclusive and rich in diversity but like Mathematics and Computing departments across Canada, we have a gender imbalance and other equity-deserving groups are also often underrepresented. Why does diversity in Mathematics and Computing matter?
4.      Why did you apply to Mount Royal University? Is there anything in particular about MRU that makes it appealing to you?
5.      The required academic credential for this position is a doctorate in a computing-related discipline, or a doctorate in another discipline with experience deemed to be relevant, or a Masterâ€™s degree, normally in a computing-related discipline, and significant work experience that would enable the candidate to make an appropriate academic contribution. Briefly comment on your formal education and how it relates to this requirement.
