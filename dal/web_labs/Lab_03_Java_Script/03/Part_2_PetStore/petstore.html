This file is simply here to allow your browser's JavaScript console to access the petstore.js file.
<p>
We recommend you use <b>Google Chrome</b> for this assignment. Open the console by CTRL + SHIFT + J.<br>
Once you've opened the console, type "<code>helloworld()</code>" in the console (without the quotes) to run the helloworld() function in petstore.js.
<p>
Your browser should print "hello world SENG 42220!" in the console. If so, you're ready to proceed!
